### Challenge 2
This is a very simple Challenge and can be solved directly by using online tools.

All we need to do is read the string embedded in th QR Code.  

Online QR converters are helpful in scanning the QR code and providing a string.

String :
```
... ...-- -.-. ..- .-. .---- - -.-- .---- ..... .-.. ----- ...- ...--
```

We can understand that the obtained string is in Morse Code.  
This morse code can again be converted using Online morse code Converters, which will result in the flag for the challenge.
